Scenario: Barkuni Corp wants to assess candidates for proficiency in Python programming language, RESTful APIs, and containerized applications. You are tasked with designing, building, and testing a REST API backend service to the best of your ability.
Goals: Build a new EKS cluster for “Barkuni Corp”. The company will run a single app in this Kubernetes cluster. Create all necessary files and add to the technical specifications outlined in the “Tools and Code” section.
• Bonus: The application must include an ALB and a DNS address registered under Route53 (test.vicarius.xyz). You should be able to access the website via HTTP and view a welcome page.
• Bonus: Implement an API router that displays all running pods in the "kube-system" namespace.
Tools and Code (must use):
1. Python - Flask
2. Terraform – Module ( use existing module )
3. Docker
4. Kubernetes manifest/Helm chart
• Bonus: Implement a pipeline for updating the code and Docker in GitHub Actions. Expected submission of work:
1. Provide Kubernetes manifests required to run your application on any kind of Kubernetes distribution (k3d, Minikube, your choice).
2. Share the Git repo and all the work in the return email and guide.
3. Share a working link for the "Scenario" part.
• Bonus: Write Python code using "boto3" that can create EC2 in a specific subnet (you will have multiple subnets) and OS (Linux, Windows, etc.) by applying an AMI number in advance.
